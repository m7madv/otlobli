# Otlobli AI Handoff

Read `CURRENT_STATE.md`, then `AGENTS.md`, before editing.

## Current Candidate

- Branch: `claude/ios6-cover-fix`.
- Current local code candidate: v85.8.48 / `APP_VERSION = 2026.07.18-v85.8.48-temu-rollback-47-no-otp-test`.
- This is an emergency rollback after the user rejected v85.8.47 on a real iPhone: product pages became blank white again and the header issue was still unresolved.
- Action: reverted commit `ae51ae8` (`fix: v85.8.47 capture Temu single style option`) and kept only a new version marker/documentation for v85.8.48.
- Runtime target: restore v85.8.46 behavior (`2fbb96d`, unfreeze Temu page after the bad `appDownload` selector) before attempting any new SKU/header work.
- Do not reapply the v85.8.47 visible-SKU/group-dims approach until the white-page regression is understood from real-device evidence or a DOM fixture that reproduces it.
- Next step: build/install v85.8.48 and verify Temu product pages are no longer blank white. Only after that, address the header separately with one narrow change.

- Rollback/reference: v85.8.5 / `a914d81` and the user-provided v85.8.5 IPA.
- v85.8.19 did not fix Temu. Current focus is Temu only; do not touch payment, wallet, completed orders, or account routes unless explicitly requested.
- v85.8.10's ordinary iPhone 16 SHEIN nav behavior was accepted. Do not call any new Temu change proven until tested on the real iPhone device; do not rely on the simulator.

## Confirmed Diagnosis

- iPhone 6 needed about 14 seconds, but the v85.8.5 readiness watchdog killed the valid WebView at 13 seconds and then showed a false VPN-server error.
- Cairo was fetched independently from Google in React and SHEIN, causing delayed nav appearance and font/size shifts.
- The full script hid generic fixed/sticky bottom elements, which could affect cookie/action UI.
- Swatches can store the real color in a nested CSS background while HOT is a smaller overlay image.

## Implementation Notes

- First iOS presentation uses `isPresentAfterPageLoad`; no hidden/`FAKE_VISIBLE` path.
- The native cover reappears at every `didStartProvisionalNavigation` and stops above the exact nav height.
- Interactive security verification is revealed after six seconds; it is not bypassed.
- Readiness is 35 seconds; preparation failure is distinct from network/VPN failure.
- Bottom-tab hiding requires verified tab semantics. Cookie adjustment and feed retry are exact and bounded.
- Cairo is self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/cairo` and embedded into the document-start script.
- Product navigation keeps the same WebView and now gets a native loading cover.
- OTP bypass is test-only.
- v85.8.7 adds semantic visual-stack detection for SHEIN's obfuscated early five-tab div, exact success-toast suppression, warm-cache fast path with bounded clean recovery, and full-bottom iOS WebView layout.
- v85.8.8 makes the injected nav DOM/grid match React, recognizes only exact five-control fixed tab geometry before labels appear, and keeps cart products hidden until both page-load and post-blocker readiness arrive.
- v85.8.9 replaces the incompatible injected Grid with four explicit Flex cells and removes the new first-session geometry scan. The v85.8.7 semantic detector and v85.8.8 product readiness gate remain.
- v85.8.10 gives all injected nav phases one CSS source and only reclaims the DOM node after actual occlusion hit-tests.
- v85.8.11 hides only the confirmed 15%-signup strip or the email-newsletter panel, with explicit real-auth exclusion.
- A SHEIN photo viewer must be fixed, near-full-screen, contain a large image, and expose a numeric image counter before viewer handling activates. Its add button is suppressed, its lower black band is guarded, and nav/back reclaim paint order only on viewer transition.
- v85.8.12 detects nested fixed viewers from targeted painted points, blocks gallery click-through at the event boundary, raises the full cookie action row without auto-consent, closes only a signed-Saudi address surface, and throttles signup/cookie scans. MutationObserver now schedules the normal coalesced tick only.
- v85.8.20 local Temu candidate broadens top search-field detection, caches search-mode probing briefly to reduce typing lag, prevents search chrome restoration from re-showing account/login panel ancestors, reapplies search-only login panel hiding if Temu redraws it, and stops home-header forcing from scrolling to top or raising the category strip with forced transform/background/z-index.
- v85.8.21 fixes a WebKit document-start abort in Cairo font injection and defers the MutationObserver until a root node exists. It nudges Temu's first-entry home header only when the category strip is missing, then returns to top. It hides the live Temu account/login surfaces by observed classes on non-account routes, including search redraws, without the previous heavy 90ms full-page text scan.
- v85.8.22 marks verified Temu category strips and forces only those strips to `display:flex`, detects focused searchboxes as search mode, lowers the active search shell by 18px, hides Temu's native search back control, and cleans login/offer sheets on non-account routes while preserving real account routes. The iOS splash PNGs are now blank white to avoid the blue logo in app switcher previews.
- v85.8.23 fixes home layout breaking after entering Temu search and backing out. Otlobli search-back now remembers/clears the search input, dispatches input/search/change, suppresses stale search-mode briefly, hides only search suggestion overlays, and prevents those overlays from being restored as category strips.
- v85.8.24 is rejected on real device. It used active search shell/frame marking plus transform/min-height CSS and caused multiple-tap search entry, moving search bar while typing, half-hidden category strip, and broken home size after exit.
- v85.8.25 removes the v85.8.24 motion/frame path. During search, Otlobli no longer restores/forces the category strip and no longer applies search-mode transform/min-height/margin CSS. Otlobli back uses a short focus-loss grace window so tapping the back button still exits search even if focus leaves the input first.
- v85.8.26 resets the active Temu blocker path: one lightweight cleaner hides only account/login, cart/basket, app-download/open-app, and promo/offer/coupon sheets. The active Temu tick no longer calls the old header/search/category forcing stack. The cleaner protects search inputs/triggers, category rows, product grids, prices, and image-heavy content; it also fixes the old broad `near search input` guard and removes generic `category/nav/menu` distraction matching from promo detection.
- v85.8.27 lightens blockers during active Temu search: it no longer hides Temu's native search back button, and the JS text/geometry cleaner returns immediately while search is active so suggestion words/letters are preserved. Static CSS blockers still apply.
- v85.8.28 adds a narrow search-only cleanup that hides compact top account/cart/menu controls and the fixed Temu bottom nav during search/results without touching suggestion text or Temu's native search back. Otlobli search exit now preserves a focused/populated query instead of clearing it.
- v85.8.29 fixes Temu product option gating for summaries that include RAM/memory/storage, including Arabic `ذاكرة الوصول العشوائي`. Otlobli add now opens the `حدد` variant row instead of adding directly when color plus memory/storage options are present.
- v85.8.30 fixes false Temu size/color gates: products with no size/RAM/model options no longer show "select size"; text-only single-color products such as `اللون: لون فضي` can add and capture the color text. v80 (`db7dfb8`) was checked and not reused because it lacks RAM/memory support and still uses the broad size-section block.

- v85.8.31 fixes two Temu product-page regressions after v85.8.30: removes early static hiding of live `panel/adaptPad` account classes so product templates cannot be blanked, adds a product-content guard to the dynamic account cleaner, and allows a selected text-only color like `اللون: اسود و ابيض` to add without a swatch image.

## Next Step

Install v85.8.31 on the real iPhone. Verify the previously white product pages first, then verify the GENBOLT text-only color product adds with `اسود و ابيض` and empty size. Also recheck that a color+RAM summary product still opens `حدد` before adding. Temu search behavior should remain like accepted v85.8.28.
