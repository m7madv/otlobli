# Otlobli AI Handoff

Read `CURRENT_STATE.md`, then `AGENTS.md`, before editing.

## Current Candidate

- Branch: `claude/ios6-cover-fix`.
- Last tested IPA: `C:\Users\MOHAMMAD\Desktop\otlobli-v85.8.19-temu-search-keyboard.ipa`.
- Last tested code: `0426529` (`fix: v85.8.19 keep Temu search keyboard open`).
- Current local code candidate: v85.8.20 / `APP_VERSION = 2026.07.17-v85.8.20-temu-header-search-login-no-otp-test`.
- v85.8.20 IPA has not been built yet.
- Rollback/reference: v85.8.5 / `a914d81` and the user-provided v85.8.5 IPA.
- v85.8.19 did not fix Temu. Current focus is Temu only; do not touch payment, wallet, completed orders, or account routes unless explicitly requested.
- v85.8.10's ordinary iPhone 16 SHEIN nav behavior was accepted. Do not call any new Temu change proven until tested on the real iPhone device; do not rely on the simulator.

## Confirmed Diagnosis

- iPhone 6 needed about 14 seconds, but the v85.8.5 readiness watchdog killed the valid WebView at 13 seconds and then showed a false VPN-server error.
- Cairo was fetched independently from Google in React and SHEIN, causing delayed nav appearance and font/size shifts.
- The full script hid generic fixed/sticky bottom elements, which could affect cookie/action UI.
- Swatches can store the real color in a nested CSS background while HOT is a smaller overlay image.

## Implementation Notes

- First iOS presentation uses `isPresentAfterPageLoad`; no hidden/`FAKE_VISIBLE` path.
- The native cover reappears at every `didStartProvisionalNavigation` and stops above the exact nav height.
- Interactive security verification is revealed after six seconds; it is not bypassed.
- Readiness is 35 seconds; preparation failure is distinct from network/VPN failure.
- Bottom-tab hiding requires verified tab semantics. Cookie adjustment and feed retry are exact and bounded.
- Cairo is self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/cairo` and embedded into the document-start script.
- Product navigation keeps the same WebView and now gets a native loading cover.
- OTP bypass is test-only.
- v85.8.7 adds semantic visual-stack detection for SHEIN's obfuscated early five-tab div, exact success-toast suppression, warm-cache fast path with bounded clean recovery, and full-bottom iOS WebView layout.
- v85.8.8 makes the injected nav DOM/grid match React, recognizes only exact five-control fixed tab geometry before labels appear, and keeps cart products hidden until both page-load and post-blocker readiness arrive.
- v85.8.9 replaces the incompatible injected Grid with four explicit Flex cells and removes the new first-session geometry scan. The v85.8.7 semantic detector and v85.8.8 product readiness gate remain.
- v85.8.10 gives all injected nav phases one CSS source and only reclaims the DOM node after actual occlusion hit-tests.
- v85.8.11 hides only the confirmed 15%-signup strip or the email-newsletter panel, with explicit real-auth exclusion.
- A SHEIN photo viewer must be fixed, near-full-screen, contain a large image, and expose a numeric image counter before viewer handling activates. Its add button is suppressed, its lower black band is guarded, and nav/back reclaim paint order only on viewer transition.
- v85.8.12 detects nested fixed viewers from targeted painted points, blocks gallery click-through at the event boundary, raises the full cookie action row without auto-consent, closes only a signed-Saudi address surface, and throttles signup/cookie scans. MutationObserver now schedules the normal coalesced tick only.
- v85.8.20 local Temu candidate broadens top search-field detection, caches search-mode probing briefly to reduce typing lag, prevents search chrome restoration from re-showing account/login panel ancestors, reapplies search-only login panel hiding if Temu redraws it, and stops home-header forcing from scrolling to top or raising the category strip with forced transform/background/z-index.

## Next Step

Run targeted validation, then build an iOS IPA only after reviewing the limited v85.8.20 diff. On the real iPhone, verify Temu opens with a clean header from first entry, the category strip remains visible without a white blank header band, search keeps the keyboard open, typing is fast, and the login/account panel does not appear during search while the real account path still works when opened intentionally.
